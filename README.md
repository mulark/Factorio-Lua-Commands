The intent of this repo is to provide a useful scratchpad for maps, scripts, and commands that assist in the overall benchmarking process. 

Items of note in the repo: 
* cloner.lua: A script to automagically copy all the entities in one area to another.
* maps: a folder containing some past map tests and benchmarks. Future maps and benchmarks will be uploaded to https://mulark.github.io
* factorio_lua_commands.lua: a lot of basic commands that I have used to bend the game state to my will. If a particuar command in this file becomes big or useful enough it will be split into a new file exclusively for it.
* inserter_primer.lua: a lua script to evaluate every inserter in the map. If the inserter needs to be primed, the script will attempt to prime it.
