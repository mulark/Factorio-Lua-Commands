The purpose of this repo is to provide a centrialized place to store Factorio maps that have been and will be used for performance testing reasons. Additional designs are welcome.

**Naming Schema:**
* {category shortname}.{design number}.{minor revision}
  * redsci.v1.0

Description should be added to the category description file, describing the general design.

More categories and maps by suggestion

**Generic RULES:**
* Mining productivity 1000 and Worker robots speed 25 are researched and may not increased further.
* You may use landfill.
* You may extend the resources or water further to the north or south as needed for designs (oil must remain the same richness), but not east or west. You may not use resources outside the vertical columns of resources.
* Pollution must remain disabled.
* Biters must remain disabled.
* If trains are used, you may not use vertical train stations on the resource patches themselves (since in the game, there are no resources patches that can be hundreds of chunks long). Horizontal stations are allowed, but must be limited to one resource per train.
* Factorio version 0.16.51 or any later stable 0.16 version may be used. 0.17 will be evaluated when it is released. 
* You may use the vanilla infinity chest to void the final product. The 6-Science category must be researching worker robots speed, no voiding may be used in this category.
* You may not used the infinity chest to create items for any of the science categories. They must be mined and processed.
* In general, if it is possible in vanilla, it is allowed.
